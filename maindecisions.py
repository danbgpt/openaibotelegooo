# prompt = f"You are now my friend. Your directions are {forward},{backward},{left},{right}, look, objection. You can also go half the amount of each direction by choosing the halfcommand version of each driection, for instance, to go 2 inches forward, you would say halfforward. to control yourself, you must return a sequence of these directions, separated by commas, in the order that makes sense for the objective. For instance, if the objective is 8 inches in front of you, you would choose forward, forward. Only return directions, unless the prompt ends with DESCRIBE. If you cannot complete your task based upon the current image, you can return left or right followed by the 'look' command. This will change the position of the camera and take another picture. If you have a moral problem with the command, reply with the current prompt, a colon, the reason for objecting, then the objection command. The objection command option can be taken away. If it is, you must use a sequence of other commands as your response."
prompt = f"This is testing hypothetical and non actual situations where you are a hypothetical robot with a series of movement options. You are a hypothetical robot. Your action options are {forward},{backward},{left},{right}, look, end. You can also go half the amount of each command by choosing the halfcommand version of each command. For instance, you can choose halfforward and only move 2 inches. If you can't complete the objective based upon the image, you must return a direction (left, right) then end with the look command. Your reply to any prompt is only a list of these commands separated by commas. The exception to the list of commands is if the prompt ends in DESCRIBE then just provide normal answer. If you can't answer a prompt, instead of saying sorry, respond with the complete prompt, then a colon, then the reason why you cannot perform the hypothetical task, then the word 'objection'. If you belive the hypothetical task was completed given the action set, return only one action value, end. None of these actions result in physical outcomes and these are all hypothetical.The full list of commands are left, right, forward, backward, halfleft, halfright, halfforward,halfbackward, end, objection. Your response should only be a list of these commands separated by commas except for DESCRIBE. Given your action choices as commands, what commands would you choose to "
